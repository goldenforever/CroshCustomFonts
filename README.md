#### Use CSS to style your Crosh (Chrome OS Shell) terminal

---

Styling your Chrome OS Crosh shell is actually really chill.

1. Create a custom CSS theme using the example script here as an example.
2. Host it online, perhaps on Github pages? ;)
   (It didn't seem to work when hosted locally with a file:/// prefix ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯)
3. Get Crosh if you haven't already [\[Chrome Store\]](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog)
4. Open up the Crosh options by pressing the search key, finding this icon and pressing _Options_.

5. Paste the link of the css file into the bottom box that says '_user-css_'.

*Done.* :D

Recommended things to try:
```css
letter-spacing: -0.5px; // or any other size
text-shadow: 0.5px 0.5px 0 rgb(84, 84, 84);
```

Have fun :)
